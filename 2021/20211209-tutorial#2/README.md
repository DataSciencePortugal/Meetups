# Managing the ML lifecycle with Mlflow

In this workshop, we will explore the functionalities of Mlflow as a platform for managing the lifecycle of machine learning experiments and models.

We will look into how it can help us record and query machine learning experiments metadata in several well-known frameworks, as well how we can store and manage models through a central repository. General machine learning, Python and Docker knowledge will help follow the tutorial.

Goal
----

Have a basic understanding of the four main components of Mlflow:
- Tracking
- Projects
- Models
- Registry

Prerequisites
--------

Basic Python and machine learning knowledge, and docker and docker-compose installed.


Setup
-----

**It is highly important to set up the docker environment before the webinar**, since it takes a while to install all the dependencies.

The provided `docker-compose.yml` will set up 4 containers:
- A PostegreSQL database;
- A minio container, emulating an object-store;
- A Mlflow server;
- A ML workspace, that contains online versions of Jupyter and VSCode.

To get everything set up, simply run inside this folder:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

It takes some minutes to get all the containers ready. After, you can access:

- Jupyter via `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Mlflow via `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
