#### Machine Learning for Helicobacter Pylori Analysis and Diagnosis in Whole Slide Image

The diagnosis of infection by the bacteria Helicobacter Pylori is often performed through manual analysis of histological images, which, due to the considerable size of these images, becomes an exhaustive task for pathologists. In this talk, we'll show you how we used Machine Learning techniques to automatically detect the presence of bacteria, indicating its location in the images. Additionally, by combining the detection of the bacterium with the identification of inflammation in the tissue, it is possible to perform the final diagnosis quickly and efficiently, also allowing visualization of the specific points in the image that support the diagnosis.

#### Improving Kidney Exchange Programs

Renal diseases affect thousands of patients who, to survive, must incur in dialysis -- a costly treatment with many negative implications in their quality of life. As an alternative, patients may enter a waiting list for receiving a kidney from a deceased donor; however, waiting times are typically very long. For reducing the waiting time, another alternative in some countries is to find a healthy living donor -- usually, a relative of a person emotionally connected -- who volunteers to cede one of their kidneys. However, in some situations transplantation is not possible due to blood, or tissue-level incompatibility. In these cases, a donor-patient pair may enter a pool of pairs in the same situation, in the hope of finding compatibility in crossed transplants.
The problem has been studied under different perspectives, but the most commonly used objective is maximizing the number of patients in the pool for which a crossed transplant is possible.
We propose to change this objective by that of maximizing the cumulative patient survival times. This model departs from the previous deterministic setting, putting into play a method for predicting survival time based on historical data.
