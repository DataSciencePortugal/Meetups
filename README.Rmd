## DSPT Github Repository

Hello,

Here is the repository where all the presentations from our past meetups are kept.

If you want to know more about our community, check out our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/datascienceportugal) and join us!

You can also check here below some interesting information about our community, which is continously growing since the first session on 20^th^ of September 2016.

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(meetupr) # for getting meetups info (Meetup's API)
library(tidyverse) 
library(highcharter) # for interactive visualizations
library(wordcloud)

# To run the meetupr functions, a meetup API key is needed
# Sys.setenv(MEETUP_KEY = "A key is needed here")
Sys.setenv(MEETUP_NAME = "Data Science Portugal (DSPT)")

urlmeetup <- "datascienceportugal"
```

```{r import, include=FALSE}
# Get events information
past_events <- get_events(urlname = urlmeetup,
                          event_status = "past")

# Get active members
current_members <- get_members(urlname = urlmeetup)
```

```{r transforming, include=FALSE}
# Transform the DSPT past events tibble for analysis
past_events <- past_events %>%
  select(id, name, local_date, local_time, waitlist_count,
         yes_rsvp_count, venue_name, venue_city, description, link) %>% 
  separate(name,
           into = c("evn_number", "title"),
           sep = "[[:space:]]{0,}-[[:space:]]{0,}",
           extra = "merge") 

# Remove the Postal Code for some venue cities
past_events$venue_city[29] <- "Ilhavo"
past_events$venue_city <- past_events$venue_city %>% 
  str_extract_all("[A-Z]{1}[a-z]*") %>% 
  unlist()

# Transform the DSPT members tibble for analysis
current_members <- current_members %>% 
  select(city, country, lat, lon)

city_members <- current_members %>% 
  count(city)

session_by_cities <- past_events %>% 
  count(venue_city) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

```

### DSPT Members' demography

There are currently **`r length(current_members$city)`** active members/followers in our meetup page. They are from  the **`r length(city_members$city)`** cities around the world, as shown here after.

```{r visualizing1, echo=FALSE, , fig.height=5, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
# Where are DSPT meetupERS coming from?

wordcloud(words = city_members$city,
          freq = city_members$n,
          min.freq = 1,
          scale = c(5, .8),
          colors = brewer.pal(12, "RdBu"))

```

### We began in the north of Portugal, but we're expanding to other cities too. 

By **`r max(past_events$local_date)`** we've already performed **`r length(past_events$id)`** meetups.
Sessions have been held in several cities in Portugal, most of them in **`r session_by_cities$venue_city[1]`** and **`r session_by_cities$venue_city[2]`**.

```{r visualizing3, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
highchart() %>%
  hc_add_series(session_by_cities, "column", hcaes(x = venue_city, y = n),
                color = "#D4432F", name = "meetups", showInLegend = FALSE) %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_smpl()) %>%
  hc_title(text = "Venue Cities",
           style = list(fontSize = "22px")) %>%
  hc_subtitle(text = paste("last ", length(past_events$id)," DSPT meetups"),
              style = list(fontSize = "12px")) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Meetups")) %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = session_by_cities$venue_city) %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Venue cities")) %>%
  hc_credits(enabled = TRUE, # add credits
             text = "Data source: DSPT Meetup / R package: meetupR & highcharter") %>%
  hc_tooltip(crosshairs = FALSE, backgroundColor = "#DDDEE6",
             shared = FALSE, borderWidth = 2)
```

### Which have been the most captivating sessions? 

The session where most people have replied **YES** to the *RSVP* request was **`r past_events$evn_number[past_events$yes_rsvp_count == max(past_events$yes_rsvp_count)]`** - **`r past_events$title[past_events$yes_rsvp_count == max(past_events$yes_rsvp_count)]`**, held in **`r past_events$venue_city[past_events$yes_rsvp_count == max(past_events$yes_rsvp_count)]`** on **`r past_events$local_date[past_events$yes_rsvp_count == max(past_events$yes_rsvp_count)]`**.

```{r visualizing2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}

# How many DSPT meetupERS have replied (RSVP) to each session
highchart() %>%
  hc_add_series(past_events,
                type = "column",
                hcaes(x = evn_number, y = yes_rsvp_count),
                name = "MeetupERS",
                color = "#149194",
                showInLegend = FALSE) %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_smpl()) %>%
  hc_title(text = "DSPT attendees by meetup",
           style = list(fontSize = "22px")) %>%
  hc_subtitle(text = "meetupERS who replied YES to RSVP",
              style = list(fontSize = "12px")) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Attendees")) %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = past_events$evn_number) %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Session")) %>%
  hc_credits(enabled = TRUE, # add credits
             text = "Data source: DSPT Meetup / R package: meetupR & highcharter") %>%
  hc_tooltip(pointFormat = "{point.title}",
             crosshairs = FALSE, backgroundColor = "#DDDEE6",
             shared = FALSE, borderWidth = 2)
